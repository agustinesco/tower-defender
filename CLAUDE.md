# Project Instructions

## Unity MCP Connection

On session start, connect to the Unity MCP server at port 8081 using `npx mcpforunity@latest 8081`.

## Unity Safety

Always ask before executing operations that may freeze Unity (e.g., running editor menu items, executing migration scripts, heavy prefab operations, domain reloads with complex scripts). Explain what the operation will do and wait for confirmation.
